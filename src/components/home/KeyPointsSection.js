					info='We give our initial howlers a HUGE incentive. For all the 7777 people who minted the wolves, we give them the hard and shiny SOL every 7 days, right in their wallets.'

					heading='Daily Staking'
					info='We are bringing staking to our howlers as well. We limit the number of staked werewolves at a given time to 1000. Each of the howlers who stake their wolves with us get daily rewards from our community treasury. The community treasury keeps getting heavier and heavier due to the 5% royalty on each secondary sale.'

					info='We sweep the bloody floors regularly using this treasury as well. But we donâ€™t do this ourselves. You decide when this happens and how this happens. Or you want to just keep holding the Sol bags in this treasury. Be our guest. This is YOUR bag.'

					heading='Mutant Roadmap'
					info='Our Mutant roadmap allows us to reduce the supply of werewolves even further and thus increase the demand and therefore the price for every werewolf. Due to the augment of the mutants and monster Werewolves, the rarity is also re-supplied in the collection to make the current werewolves left in supply even more in demand.
